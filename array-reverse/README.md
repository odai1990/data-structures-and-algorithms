## Approach & Efficiency

#### I have used simple way in reversing array is switching and avoid using nested for loop because this will cost time and memory ... therefore my code represent  O(N) not O(N^2)... also I used pseudocode and algorithm to apply my idea before writing code .. then i verified my code with simple table to test me code .. and of course i put my code under edgecase.
