# Singly Linked List


## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

## Approach & Efficiency
I used two classes and used one class for Node and other to create Object form Node class.

## API

`--init--` : it will initialize a linked list.
`insert` : it will insert a node into the list.
`includes` : it takes a value then checks if it's in the array.
`__str__`: it will print the array in a specific way.
`__append__`: it adds a value to the end.
