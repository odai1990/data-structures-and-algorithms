# Hashtables
- Array of linked list that store ahsed key and value in tuple 

## Challenge

- Bulding a hastabell using linked list for collison 

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O

O(n)

## API
- add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling - collisions as needed.
- find: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
- contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- hash_table: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
